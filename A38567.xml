         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS I was coming, a while ſince, out of <hi>Italy,</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> that I might not waſte all that time I was to ſit on Horsback, in fooliſh and illiterate Fables, I choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one while to revolve with my ſelf, ſomething of our common Studies, and other while, to enjoy the remembrance of my Friends, of whom, I left here, ſome no leſſe learned, than pleaſant; Amongſt theſe, you, my <hi>More,</hi> came firſt in my mind, whoſe memory, though abſent your ſelf, gives me ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in my abſence, as when preſent with you, I ever found in your company; than which, let me
<pb facs="tcp:49854:3"/>periſh, if in all my life, I ever met with any thing more delectable: And therefore, being ſatisfy'd that ſomething was to be done, and that, that time was no wiſe proper for any ſerious matter, I reſolv'd to make ſome ſport with <hi>The Praiſe of Folly:</hi> But who the Devil put that in thy head? you'l ſay; The firſt thing, was your ſirname, of <hi>More,</hi> which comes ſo near the word <hi>Moriae</hi> (Folly) as you are far from the thing; And that you are ſo, all the world will clear you: In the next place, I conceiv'd this exerciſe of wit, would not be leaſt approv'd by you, inaſmuch as you are wont to be delighted with ſuch kind of mirth, that is to ſay, neither unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if I am not miſtaken, nor altogether inſipid, and in the whole courſe of your life, have play'd the part of a <hi>Democritus:</hi> And though, ſuch is the excellence of your Judgement, that 'twas ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the peoples, yet ſuch is your incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affability, and ſweetneſs of temper, that you both can, and delight to carry your ſelf to all men, a man of all hours: Wherefore, you will not only, with good will accept this ſmall Declamation, but take upon you the defence of 't, foraſmuch, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to you, it is now no longer mine, but yours: But perhaps, there will not be wanting ſome wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, that may cavil, and charge me, partly, that theſe toyes are lighter than may became a Divine, and partly, more biting, than may beſeem the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a Chriſtian, and conſequently exclaim, that
<pb facs="tcp:49854:3"/>I reſemble the Ancient Comedy, or another <hi>Lucian,</hi> and ſnarle at every thing: But I would have them, whom the lightneſs, or foolery of the Argument may offend, to conſider, that mine is not the firſt of this kind, but the ſame thing, that has been often pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd even by great Authors; when <hi>Homer,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages ſince, did the like with the battel of Frogs and Mice; <hi>Virgil,</hi> with the Gnat, and Puddings; <hi>Ovid,</hi> with the Nut; When <hi>Polycrates,</hi> and his Corrector <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> extor'd Tyranny; <hi>Glauco,</hi> Injuſtice; <hi>Favorinus,</hi> Deformity, and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague; <hi>Syneſcius,</hi> Baldneſs; <hi>Lucian,</hi> the Fly, and Flattery: When <hi>Seneca</hi> made ſuch ſport with <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Canonizations; <hi>Plutarch,</hi> with his Dialogue between <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and <hi>Gryllus; Lucian</hi> and <hi>Apuleius,</hi> with the Aſſe; and ſome other, I know not who, with the Hog that made his loſt Will and Teſtament, of which alſo, even S. <hi>Jerome</hi> makes mention: And therefore if they pleaſe, let 'em ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I play'd at Tables for my diverſion, or if they had rather have it ſo, that I red on a Hobby-horſe: for what injuſtice is it, that when we allow every courſe of life its Recreation, that Study only, ſhould have none eſpecially, when ſuch toyes, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſerious matter, and foolery is ſo handled, that the Reader that is not altogether thick-skull'd, may reap more benefit from 't, than from ſome mens crabbiſh, and ſpecious Arguments? As when one, with long ſtudy, and great pains, patches many pieces
<pb facs="tcp:49854:4"/>together, on the praiſe of Rhetorick, or Philoſophy; another, makes a Panegyrick to a Prince; another, encourages him to a War againſt the Turks; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tells you what will become of the world, after himſelf is dead; and another, finds out ſome new device for the better ordering of Goats-wooll: for as nothing is more trifling than to treat of ſerious matters triflingly; ſo nothing carries a better grace, than ſo to diſcourſe of trifles, as a man may ſeem to have intended them leaſt: For my own part, Let other men judge of what I have written; though yet, unleſſe an overweening opinion of my ſelf, may have made me blind in my own cauſe, I have prais'd <hi>Folly,</hi> but not altogether fooliſhly: And now, to ſay ſomewhat, to that other cavil, of biting; this liberty was ever permitted to all mens wits, to make their ſmart witty reflections on the common errors of mankind, and that too, without offence, as long as this liberty does not run into licentiouſneſs; which makes me the more admire the tender ears, of the men of this age, that can away with ſolemn Titles, Nay, you'l meet with ſome, ſo prepoſterouſly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they will ſooner endure the broadeſt ſcoffs, even againſt Chriſt himſelf, than hear the Pope or a Prince be toucht in the leaſt, eſpecially, if it be any thing that concerns their profit; whereas he that ſo taxes the lives of men, without naming any one in particular, whither I pray, may he be ſaid to bite, or rather to teach, and admoniſh? or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:49854:4"/>I beſeech ye, under how many notions do I tax my ſelf? Beſides, he that ſpares no ſort of men, cannot be ſaid to be angry, with any one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but the vices of all; And therefore, if there ſhall happen to be any one, that ſhall ſay he is hit, he will but diſcover, either his guilt or fear: Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> ſported in this kind with more freedome, and greater ſharpneſſe, not ſparing ſometimes, mens very name. But I, beſides that I have wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, I have ſo moderated my ſtile, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader, will eaſily perceive, my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours herein, were rather to make mirth, than bite: Nor have <hi>I,</hi> after the Example of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> raked up that forgotten ſink of filth and ribaldry, but laid before you, things, rather ridiculous, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt: And now, if there be any one, that is yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, let him at leaſt remember, that it is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, to be diſcommended by <hi>Folly;</hi> and having brought her in, ſpeaking, it was but fit, that <hi>I</hi> kept up the character of the perſon. But why do <hi>I</hi> run over theſe things to you, a perſon ſo excellent an Advocate, that no man better defends his Client, though the cauſe many times, be none of the beſt? Farewell, my leſt diſputant <hi>More,</hi> and ſtoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your <hi>Moriae.</hi>

               </gap>) the Lions skin, Go to, and I'll ſhew ye, that this happineſſe of Chriſtians, which they purſue with ſo much toil, is nothing elſe, but a kind of madneſſe and folly; far be it, that my words ſhould give any offence, rather conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, my matter: And firſt, the Chriſtians and Platonicks, do as good as agree in this, that the Soul is plung'd, and fetter'd in the priſon of the body, by the groſſneſſe of which, it is ſo ty'd up, and hinder'd, that it cannot take a view of, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy things, as they truly are; and for that cauſe, their maſter defines Philoſophy, to be a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of death, becauſe it takes off the mind, from viſible and corporeal objects, than which, death does no more; And therefore, as long as the Soul uſeth the Organs of the Body in that right manner it ought, ſo long it is ſaid to be in good ſtate and condition; but when having
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49854:82"/>broke its fetters, it endeavours to get looſe, and aſſayes, as it were, a flight out of that priſon, that holds it in, they call it madneſs; and if this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen through any diſtemper, or indiſpoſition of the organs, then, by the common conſent of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, 'tis down-right madneſſe: And yet we ſee ſuch kind of men, foretell things to come, underſtand Tongues and Letters, they never learnt before, and ſeem as it were, big with a kind of Divinity: Nor is it to be doubted, but that it proceeds from hence, that the mind being ſomewhat at liberty, from the infection of the body, begins to put forth it ſelf, in its native vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; and I conceive, 'tis from the ſame cauſe, that the like often happens, to ſick men, a little before their death, that they diſcourſe in ſtrain above mortality, as if they were inſpir'd: Agen, if this happens, upon the ſcore of Religion, though perhaps it may not be the ſame kind of madneſs, yet 'tis ſo near it, that a great many men, would judge it no better, eſpecially, when a few inconſiderable people, ſhall differ from the reſt of the world, in the whole courſe of their life: And therefore it fares with them, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fiction of <hi>Plato,</hi> happens to thoſe, that being coopt up in a cave, ſtand gaping with admiration, at the ſhadows of things; &amp; that fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who having broke from 'em, and returning to 'em agen, told 'em he had ſeen, things truly as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49854:83"/>they were, and that they were the moſt miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in believing there was nothing but pitiful ſhadows: for as this wiſe man, pitty'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd, their palpable madneſs, that were poſſeſt with ſo groſſe an error; ſo they, in return, laught at him, as a doating fool, and caſt him out of their company: In like manner, the common ſort of men, chiefly admire thoſe things, that are moſt corporeal, and almoſt believe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond 'em; whereas on the contrary, theſe devout perſons, by how much the nearer, any thing concerns the body, by ſo much the more they neglect it, and are wholly hurry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the contemplation of things inviſible; for the one, give the firſt place to riches, the next, to their corporal pleaſures, leaving the laſt place to their ſoul, which yet, moſt of 'em do ſcarce believe, becauſe they can't ſee it with their eyes: On the contrary, the others, firſt, rely wholly on God the moſt unchangeable of all things; and next him, yet on this that comes neareſt him, they beſtow the ſecond on their ſoul; and laſtly, for their body, they neglect that care, and contemn, and fly monies, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity that may be well ſpar'd; or if they are forc't to meddle, with any of theſe things, they do it careleſly, and much againſt their wills, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as if they had it not, and poſſeſſing, as if they poſſeſſed it not: There are alſo in each
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49854:83"/>ſeveral things, ſeveral degrees, wherein they diſagree among themſelves: And firſt, as to the ſenſes, though all of 'em, have more or leſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with the body, yet of theſe, ſome are more groſs, and blockiſh, as taſting, hearing, ſeeing, ſmelling, touching; ſome more remov'd from the body, as memory, intellect, and the will: and therefore to which of theſe the mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies its ſelf, in that lyes it force: But holy men, becauſe the whole bent of their minds, is taken up with thoſe things, that are moſt repugnant to theſe groſſer ſenſes, they ſeem brutiſh, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, in the common uſe of them: Whereas on the contrary, the ordinary ſort of people, are beſt at theſe, and can do leaſt at to'ther, from whence it is, as we have heard, that ſome of theſe holy men, have, by miſtake, drunk oil, for wine: Agen, in the affections of the mind, ſome have a greater commerce with the body, than others, as luſt, deſire of meat, and ſleep, anger, pride, envy, with which, holy men are at irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enmity; and contrary, the common people, think there's no living without 'em: And laſtly, there are certain middle kind of affections, and as it were, natural to every man; As the love of ones Country, Children, Parents, Friends, and to which, the common people attribute no ſmall matter; whereas to'ther, ſtrive to pluck 'em out of their mind; unleſſe, inſomuch as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49854:84"/>they arrive to that higheſt part of the ſoul, that they love their Parents, not as Parents, (for what did they get but the body? though yet we owe it to God, not them) but as good men, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in whom, ſhines the Image of that higheſt wiſdom, which alone, they call the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, and out of which, they ſay there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be belov'd or deſir'd: And by the ſame rule, do they meaſure all things elſe, ſo that they make leſſe account, of whatever is viſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be altogether contemptible, than of thoſe things, which they cannot ſee: But they ſay, that in Sacraments, and other religious Duties, there is both body, and Spirit: As in faſting, they count it not enough for a man to abſtain from eating (which the common people take for an abſolute Faſt) unleſſe there be alſo a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of his deprav'd affections: As that he be leſſe angry, leſs proud, than he was wont, that the Spirit being leſs clog'd, with its bodily weight, may be the more intent upon heavenly things: In like manner, in the Euchariſt, though, ſay they, it is not to be eſteem'd the leſs, that 'tis adminiſter'd with Ceremonies, yet of its ſelf, 'tis of little effect, if not hurtful, unleſs that which is ſpiritual be added to it, to wit, that which is repreſented under thoſe viſible ſignes: Now the death of Chriſt is repreſented by it, which all men, vanquiſhing, aboliſhing, and as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49854:84"/>it were, burying their carnal affections, ought to expreſs, in their lives and converſations, that they may grow up, to a newneſs of life, and be one with him, and the ſame, one amongſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This a holy man does, and in this, is his only meditation: Whereas on the contrary, the common people think there's no more in that Sacrifice, than to be preſent at the Altar, and crow'd next it, to have a noiſe of words, and look upon the Ceremonies: Nor in this alone, which we onely propos'd by way of example, but in all his life, and without hypoc iſie, does a holy man fly thoſe things, that have any alliance with the body, and is wholly raviſht, with things Eternal, Inviſible, and Spiritual: for which cauſe, there's ſo great a contrariety of opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, and that too, in every thing, that each party, thinks the other out of their wits; though that character, in my judgment, better agrees with thoſe holy men, than the common people: which yet, will be more clear, if as I promis'd, I briefly ſhew ye, that that great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they ſo much fancy, is nothing elſe but a kind of madneſs: And therefore ſuppoſe, that <hi>Plato</hi> dreamt of ſomewhat like it, when he call'd the madneſs of Lovers, the moſt happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all others: for he that's violently in Love, lives not in his own body, but in the thing he loves; and by how much the farther he runs
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49854:85"/>from himſelf, into another by ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is his pleaſure; and then, when the mind ſtrives to rove from its body, and does not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe its own organs, without doubt, you may ſay, 'tis downright madneſſe, and not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: or otherwiſe, what's the meaning of thoſe common ſayings <hi>(Non eſt apud ſe: Ad te re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di: Sibi redditus eſt)</hi> He does not dwell at home: Come to your ſelf: He's his own man again? Beſides, the more perfect, and true, his love is, the more pleaſant is his madneſs: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what is that life hereafter, after which, theſe holy minds, ſo pantingly breathe, like to be? To wit, the Spirit ſhall ſwallow up the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as conqueror, and more durable; and this it ſhall do, with the greater eaſe, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, in its life-time, it had cleans'd and thinn'd it into ſuch another nothing as its ſelf: And then, the Spirit agen, ſhall be wonderfully ſwallow'd up, by that higheſt mind, as being more powerful, than infinite parts; So that the whole man is to be out of himſelf, nor to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe happy in any reſpect, but that being ſtript of himſelf, he ſhall participate of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ineffable, from that chiefeſt good, that draws all things into its ſelf: And this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though 'tis only then perfected, when ſouls being joyn'd to their former bodies, ſhall be made immortal, yet foraſmuch as the life of holy
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49854:85"/>men, is nothing but a continu'd meditation, and as it were ſhadow of that life, it ſo happens, that at length, they have ſome taſte or reliſh of it; which, though it be but as the ſmalleſt drop, in compariſon of that fountain of eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it far ſurpaſſes all worldly delight, though all the pleaſures of all mankind, were all joyn'd together: So much better are things ſpiritual, than things corporal, and things invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, than things viſible; which doubtleſs is that, which the Prophet promiſeth; The eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, nor has it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man to conſider, what God has provided for them that love him: And this is that, <hi>Mary</hi>'s better part, which is not taken away, by change of life, but perfected: And therefore, they that are ſenſible of it (and few there are, to whom this happens) ſuffer a kind of ſomewhat, little differing from madneſs; for they utter many things, that do not hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that too, not after the manner of men; but make a kind of ſound, which they neither heed themſelves, nor is it underſtood by others, and change the whole figure of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; One while jocund, another while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, now weeping, then laughing, and agen ſighing: And when they come to themſelves, tell ye, they know not where they have been, whether in the body, or out of the body, or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49854:86"/>ſleeping; nor do they remember what they have heard, ſeen, ſpoken, or done, and only know this, as it were in a miſt or dream, that they were the moſt happy, while they were ſo out of their wits; And therefore they are ſorry, they are come to themſelves agen, and deſire nothing more, than this kind of madneſſe, to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mad: And this is a ſmall taſte of that future happineſs.
